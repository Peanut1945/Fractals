        <p>Now you may ask, how on earth do you get non-whole number dimentions? Well,
            that is the beauty of fractals, they don't conform to our usual concept of a dimention.
            To explore this let's take it from the basics.
        </p>
        <img src="images/line.jpg" alt="" class="Image">
        <p> Here we can see the scale factor for a line is k. When you increase it's length  </br> but 
        the scale factor for a square (two dimensional shape) is kÂ².
        </p>

        <img src="images/twoDimentions.jpg" alt="" class="Image">
        <p>What is cool is that the scale factor of the line has a power of 1 (it's one dimensional) and the 
            square has 2 (two dimensional). So why don't we apply this to a fractal.

            <p>If we take this Kock curve, we know that it will take some size x and if we scale it, 
                it will become size xk^d where d is the number of dimensions. But if we look, the curve is 
                made up of 4 smaller versions of itself, where each of these sections is 1/3 of the length of the curve.
            </p>

            <p>This means we have a shape made of k = 3 so (3^d)x is the area of the full curve. But it is made of 4 lots of x (where x is the area of the smaller section).
            Putting this into mathematical terms (3^d)x = 4x
            Here we can just cancel out the x meaning we have 4 = 3^d. <br> From here it's just a simple process, we take the log()
            of both sides and re-arrange : d log(3) = log(4) => d = log(4)/log(3). This is approximately 1.262; meaning the curve has 1.262 dimensions.</p>
