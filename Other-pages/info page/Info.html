            Please do be aware that the website may have more issues on mobile devices as I made it for my computer before allowing access to phones etc.
            Along with this if anyone could help me with the mandlebrot set and getting it to zoom in properly , or improve the efficiency of the code it woul be greatly apreciated.
            Because of the aformentioned points I would recomend the use of a pc to explore the website.
